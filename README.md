## 🦙 Tina CMS

By default, this template comes pre-configured with Tina CMS.

Now you can create your posts directly from the CMS without the need to do it manually.

If you decide to use Tina, it's not necessary to add any properties to the Markdown files, Tina does it automatically.

The documentation for Tina CMS can be found [here](https://tina.io/docs/)

> Tina is completely optional, and you can remove it, and it will still function in the same way.
