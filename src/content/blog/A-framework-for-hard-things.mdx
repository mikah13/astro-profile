title: A framework for hard things
---

As the title suggests, this post is about creating a framework to overcome challenges. I often find myself in tough spots, where I panic and consider backing down from a challenge. Even when I decided to continue, my performance was not as good as I hoped. Looking back, I ask myself why I struggled and worried so much instead of focusing on how to achieve it. It's like going into a battle without knowing the opponents, preparing weapons, or making a plan. I realized I needed to change internally and be more prepared for any situation. I need a new mindset to welcome challenges as opportunities. Instead of seeing "challenges," I want to see "opportunities."

I can always procrastinate and freestyle it, but just like building a new project, why not create a framework to get it done much quicker? A framework that I can add more "features" over time to deal with things I typically handle. Once I adopt it, I won't be stressed all the time and can focus on developing a solution.

So, how should I go about it? Let's start by shaping your mind to see "Challenges" as "Opportunities"

```ts
const object = new Challenge()
console.log(object.type) // "Opportunity"
```

First of all, let's define all the characteristics of an Opportunity

```java
public class Opportunity {
    private Risk risk;
    private Reward reward;
    private Outcome outcome;
    private Opportunity[] challenges;
}

public class Challenge extends Opportunity {
    static private boolean isDifficult = true;
    static private boolean isBoring = true;
    static private boolean isNegative = true;
}

```

Whenever something new comes to you, before judging whether it's positive or negative, ask yourself these questions:

- What are the risks if I do this?
- What are the rewards if I succeed?
- What are the rewards even if I don't?
- What are my goals?

When I started to go through the process, I spent less time worrying about whether this was bad or good for me. I value my time more and focus on working toward the goals that I set for myself. Slowly, I also learned more lessons from this process:

- There will always be something negative about it, but a second I spend on them is a second I miss out on a good opportunity.
- There will be things that I don't like doing, and I refuse to give them more power and attention than they deserve.
- I also understand that stress is just my body and mind's reaction when they are going through something new, and they are temporary. Fear, feeling, and emotion have nothing to do with how the outcome would be, unless, I let them take control of my mind.
- It's all about perspective. Nothing is entirely good or bad so keep your head neutral and focus

While this is my personal opinion, I believe that the process of overcoming barriers and challenges is essential for everybody to grow. What works for me may not work for everyone, so it's important to find a framework that suits your individual development. I hope you take away the idea that life can be both hard and easy. Understanding why you feel negative is important, but it's even more crucial to learn how to handle these feelings. Being mentally prepared to tackle challenges can make a significant difference in how we approach them in the future.\
